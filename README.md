Approach: We first calculated the initial probabilities, the transition probabilities and emission probabilities based on our training dataset. These probabilities are then passed on to our algorithms (i.e.. Simplified, VE, and MAP).

Please note our approaches for Simplified, Variable Elimination and Viterbi ARE THE SAME for both programs:
	For the Simplified algorithm we calculate the max of P(E|S)P(S) we calculate P(S) by mainitaining a table that would contain the count of each label while training
	For the Variable Elimination algorithm weâ€™ve used the forward-backward approach. Wherein alpha is P(St,E1,E2,E3...Et) and beta is P(St|Et+1,Et+2,....ET). We calculated the state where the product of alpha and beta is the maximum.
	For the Viterbi algorithm
	
For question 1 we are using the following definitions of emissions and transitions:
	1. Emision: The probability of word occuring given its label. P('The'|Noun) or P('The'|Verb) or P('The'|Determinant) and so on.
	2. Transition: The probability of a label occuring given the previous label. P(Noun|Verb) or P(Verb|Determinant) and so on.

For question 2 we are using the following definitions of emissions and transitions:
	1. Emision: The probability of character occuring given an image. This is calculated by pixel matching of the matrix with the different matrices present in the training set. After experimentation and after findng better results, higher weight is assigned for matched pixels and less weight is assigned for matched spaces.
	2. Transition: The probability of a character occuring given the previous character. P('a'|'b') or P('b'|'c') and so on.
